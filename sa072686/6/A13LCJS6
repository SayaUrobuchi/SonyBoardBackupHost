When driving through a city, an intersection usually offers one the choice of
going straight on or turning left or right through 90 degrees. However some
cities have diagonal roads, thus at intersections involving these one may be
able to turn through 45 degrees (``half'') or through 135 degrees (``sharp'').

Consider such a city with Avenues running north-south, Streets running
east-west and Boulevards running diagonally. The central Avenue and Street
are labelled Zero (A0 and S0). Other roads are labelled relative to these,
thus A3W is the third avenue to the west of A0. There are 6 Boulevards--two
passing through the centre of the city, and 4 others, one in each quadrant.
The diagram below shows the northwest quadrant of a small version of such a
city.

The roads marked in grey are considered to be throughways. These are elevated
for most of their length, thus it is possible to cross them easily, however
they always intersect each other at a circle, which is shared by all other
roads that meet at that intersection. You may only enter or leave them by
turning left (sharp left in the case of boulevards). You may not stop on them
for any reason. There are no restrictions on turns for other roads.

This system allows a very simple method of determining one's current position
and a way of arriving at one's destination. Position can be specified in
terms of the last intersection you passed through (the numbers of the Avenue
and Street that meet there) and your current heading, which can be one of:
north (N), northeast (NE), east (E), southeast (SE), south (S), southwest
(SW), west (W) and northwest (NW). Directions can then be given in terms of
how many intersections to pass through and which turns to make. However, the
locals have an infuriating habit of giving incorrect or invalid directions,
although it cannot be determined whether this is deliberate or accidental.
Directions should (but don't always) conform to the following simple grammar:

Write a program that will simulate driving through such a city, by tracking
your position and heading as you follow a set of directions (commands). Each
quadrant of the city will be 50 blocks by 50 blocks, thus the entire city
will be 100 blocks by 100 blocks, the outer throughways will be labelled
Fifty and the major and minor boulevards will cross at roads labelled
Twentyfive. You will be told your starting position and heading and then
given a series of directions. If a direction does not follow the above
grammar, or would involve an illegal or impossible turn then ignore it. At no
stage will directions take you out of the confines of the city.

Input will consist of a series of scenarios.

Each scenario will consist of a position and a heading and will be followed
by a series of directions (commands), each on a separate line. If either of
the roads involved is one of the central roads (A0, S0), they will be
labelled N or E as appropriate. Note that you may assume that you have just
left the intersection specified. The GO <n> command means that you pass
through <n> intersections.

Ryan Pai:

Ok, I just got AC and I spent so much time on this problem that I would like
to make clear what the rules are:

¶â¡A§Ú AC ¤F¡A¨Ã¥Bªá¤F«Ü¦h®É¶¡§Ë²M·¡³W«h¡C

First check if the turn makes sense at all (i.e. there is a road in the
direction you want to turn). If not then obviously the turn is NOT valid.

­º¥ý½T»{Âà¦V¬O§_¥i¦æ¡]§Y¡AÂà¦V«á¦³¨S¦³¹D¸ô¥i¨«¡H¡^­Y§_¡AÅãµM¥¦¤£¦Xªk¡C

Next check if you are entering or exiting a throughway (remember the
throughways are the dark grey streets). If you are not entering or exiting a
throughway, then the turn IS valid. Entering is defined as starting the turn
on a non-throughway and ending it on a throughway. Exiting is just the
opposite, starting on the throughway and ending on a non-throughway.

±µµÛ½T»{§A¬O§_¥¿­n¶i¤J©ÎÂ÷¶} throughway¡]throuway ´N¬O·t¦Ç¦âªºµó¹D¡^¡C

±q non-throughway ¶}©l¡AÂà¦V«á¦b throughway¡CÂ÷¶}«h¤Ï¤§¡A±q throughway ¶}©l

¦b non-throughway µ²§ô¡C

The remaining case is that of entering or exiting. If you are at one of the
nine special circle intersections, then the turn IS valid (Thanks Per).

Finally if entering or exiting the turn is valid only in the following cases:
a) The turn is SHARP LEFT and the throughway involved is a boulevard
b) The turn is (normal) LEFT and the throughway involved is NOT a boulevard

³Ì«á¡A¶i¥X¦Xªk¶È¦³¥H¤U±¡§Î¡G

b) ©Ò²o¯A¨ìªº throughway ¤£¬O Boulevard ¨Ã¥BÂà¦V¬° (normal) LEFT

I hope this helps. If you have any other questions about it you can ask me.
