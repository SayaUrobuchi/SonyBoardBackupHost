                       390  Letter Sequence Analysis

Cryptographic analysis makes extensive use of the frequency with which
letters and letter sequences occur in a language. If an encrypted text is
known to be in english, for example, a great deal can be learned from the
fact that the letters E, L, N, R, S, and T are the most common ones used in
written english. Even more can be learned if common letter pairs, triplets,
etc. are known.

For this problem you are to write a program which accepts as input a text
file of unspecified length and performs letter sequence analysis on the text.
The program will report the five most frequent letter sequences for each set
of sequences from one to five letters. That is it will report the individual
characters which occur with the five highest frequencies, the pairs of
characters which occur with the five highest frequencies, and so on up to the
letter sequences of five characters which occur with the five highest
frequencies.

The program should consider contiguous sequences of alphabetic characters
only, and case should be ignored (e.g. an `a' is the same as an `A'). A
report should be produced using the format shown in the example at the end of
this problem description. For each sequence length from one to five, the
report should list the sequences in descending order of frequency. If there
are several sequences with the same frequency then all sequences should be
listed in alphabetical order as shown (list all sequences in upper case).
Finally, if there are less than five distinct frequencies for a particular
sequence length, simply report as many distinct frequency lists as possible.
Print a blank line between two analises.
